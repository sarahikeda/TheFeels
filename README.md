== TheFeels

 Sometimes we can lose track of how we communicate in relationships and it'd be helpful to have an overview of just how we say the things we do. TheFeels is a Rails app which analyzes the emotional content of our email correspondence(specifically, Gmail). See what sentiment you actually convey and how it evolves over time.
